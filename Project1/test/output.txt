Won't Get Fooled Again - The Who

We'll be fighting in the streets with our children at our feet and the
morals that they worship will be gone and the men who spurred us on sit in
judgement of all wrong they decide and the shotgun sings the song
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck
If a woodchuck could chuck wood?
As much wood as a woodchuck could chuck,
If a woodchuck could chuck wood.
